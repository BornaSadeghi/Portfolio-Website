                    "Sweden aims to reduce its net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero, by 2045.
                    Working with the Swedish Wind Energy Association (SWEA), you have been contracted
                    to design wind turbines in a new wind farm. The wind turbines must be clean and
                    sustainable while efficiently providing power to multiple cities."
                    <strong>Design a wind turbine to generate large amounts of power.</strong>
